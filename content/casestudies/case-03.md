#### Automatic, Continuous Discovery of Your Full Application Stack

* A single, lightweight agent per host continually discovers all components and deploys sensors crafted to monitor each technology
* With no human intervention, sensors automatically collect configuration, changes, metrics, and events
* Metrics from all components are collected in high fidelity with 1 second data granularity
* Every request is traced across each microservice, automatically capturing the response time and context. No sampling, no partial traces
* To understand how a system of services works together and the impact of component failure, Instana enhances traces with information about the underlying service, application, and system infrastructure using our Dynamic Graph

#### Build a Dependency Map for Real-Time Performance Analysis

* All gathered data is organized into dependency relationships in our custom data store, the Dynamic Graph, continuously modeling your services and infrastructure
* Every discovered component becomes a node in the graph that captures its state and includes metric data, configuration, dependencies, and component health
* Continuous discovery defines the evolving dependency chain of the Dynamic Graph enabling both temporal and spatial deterministic analysis

#### Gain an Immediate and Exact Understanding of Performance

* Stream processing is used to analyze incoming data in real-time, uncovering service issues and creating “Incidents” nearly instantaneously
* Every component’s health is determined by applying machine learning and preset health rules. “Issues” are created for any unhealthy component, while Incidents are only raised when end users are impacted
* An Incident is a ‘root cause report’ with a correlated sequence of Events and Issues identifying the exact source of the problem
* Incidents include metrics, traces, exceptions, logged errors, and configuration data correlated via the Dynamic Graph to facilitate root cause analysis

#### Optimize Performance with Unbounded Analytics™

* Unbounded Analytics is an analysis capability covering all of the browser and backend trace details collected by Instana
* Filter every aspect of your data in an unlimited combination of ways, discovering performance outliers, problem patterns, or uniquely tagged traces
* Some problems require more effort and sleuthing to solve. All Traces (remember, Instana doesn’t sample) are available to help you find the needle in the haystack
