#### Hello World

The journey began in April 2018 with the [Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot](https://github.com/codecentric/chaos-monkey-spring-boot), which [Benjamin Wilms](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-wilms-653383174/) published as Open Source project. Prompted by the great feedback he received, the idea was born to start a company based on the Chaos Engineering tool and the expertise gained from it. In the fall of 2019, Benjamin founded steadybit together with [Dennis Schulte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-schulte-18b5b92/) and [Johannes Edmeier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannes-edmeier-48793919b/). During their time at codecentric AG, they gained a lot of expertise in Chaos Engineering and the implementation of distributed highly available systems.

[Rainer Vehns](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rainer-vehns/) (Co-Founder & CEO [codecentric AG](https://www.codecentric.de/)) and [Mirko Novakovic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mirkonovakovic/) (Co-Founder & CEO [Instana](https://www.instana.com/)) strongly supported the new startup steadybit from the very beginning. This close relationship between the founder teams is a unique asset and a great accelerator.

#### Introduction

Today's systems are constantly changing through the practices of continuous deployment. In order to respond quickly and flexibly to customer needs, today's release processes are optimized and systems are continuously changing.

This speed requires a maximum of reliability and trust. So far, current tools in the field of Chaos Engineering have only covered specific areas and require expert knowledge in handling these tools. steadybit strives to close this gap by making Chaos Engineering accessible to everyone.

#### Technologies

They provide an easy-to-use Software-as-a-Service solution. For those who need to control everything, steadybit offers also an on-prem version.

steadybit discovers all kinds of information and metadata from the environment allowing users to write targeted chaos experiments. It supports a wide range of technologies: AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Linux VMs, â€¦

#### What's next?

The team is currently working on many new unique platform features which will be rolled out in the upcoming months. Thanks to the Zero Configuration and Auto Update approach, customers will automatically receive all new features and adjustments.
