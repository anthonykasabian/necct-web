subtitle: A small introduction what we're doing

---
A lot has happened in the area of innovation at codecentic in the past year. Like many other areas, it was strongly influenced by the uncertainties as well as opportunities brought about by the Corona pandemic.

In September, there was an email from Lars to everyone, titled _"New approach to generate ideas and continuously reinvent our business"_, which communicated the reorganization of the Innovation area. It described the two parts, **Inno by the team**, led by Alexander Sachs and **necct**, led by Lorenz Fendes. Set up as a joint team working to find new revenue streams outside the core business.

We have received feedback from some that it was not always clear how the two - **necct** & **inno by the team** - relate to each other and what this means for codecentric and the core business. Due to the departure of Alexander Sachs, who left us in January, we will remove this division as both will now be united in the necct unit.

**necct** is an **independent** **unit** responsible for implementing the above-mentioned goal of '**finding new sources of revenue outside the core business'.** The main focus of our activities is as follows:

#### Internal: Finding and promoting ideas in codecentric (also known as Inno by the team).

As the past has shown, there are always great and valuable ideas emerging from our ranks on how to solve problems and generate value for the user. Whether they come from the common workday or from private experiences: Whenever you have an idea for a product solution or a new application, you can come to us. A starting point for your ideas can be the further developed [**Ideasplatform**](https://ideaplatform.cc/) (access to this can be found as before in the 1Password Vault). Here you will find an overview of the most important points (which you don't have to have answered immediately, but which you could think about), further resources for validation (Ã  la Business Model Canvas) and you can also simply enter your ideas there directly. As it is the case now, you are always welcome to contact Leonie or Lorenz directly with your ideas.

We help you from a raw idea to a product idea (idea sparring & validation steps), from the product idea to the product vision (e.g. with product vision workshops and business model canvas) and from the product vision to market entry (go-to-market strategy & marketing support). We accompany you step by step and support you with our time, internal and sometimes also external resources and can build on learnings from previous projects.

#### External: Innovation showcase and co-creation

codecentric is a pioneer in innovative technologies and new approaches to problem solving. Until now, we have mainly stayed within the realm of IT with this knowledge and few points of contact outside of IT. We would like to change this with our co-creation approach. Together with the network and knowledge of other companies we want to open up new areas and help others with value-driven product developments.

This is currently happening in both directions: Companies approach us and look for a tech investor with development power but also expertise and vision to rethink and build products together. But we also actively approach other companies of which we believe that together we can get something off the ground.

In the next few days, we will also launch our own necct website, so that we can present ourselves innovatively to potential partners off the codecentric path and not soften the codecentric message with Inno projects.

#### Currently, we are dealing with the following topics, among others:

* Regular idea sparring (most recently, for example, an idea from Hamburg and one from our Dutch colleagues)
* Spin-off, go-to-market support and branding for Tallido
* Next steps and further development of the business model with Infinite Devices regarding SmartCountr but also beyond that
* Renewed tactics.AI push in search of the right partners and positioning (e.g. scouting departments vs. analysts)
* Landing page and customer address for the LocalArtsGallery
* Launching a new co-creation approach as an Inno project that brings sustainable startups and investors together as easily as possible

  
  
In the Slack channel **#innovation**, we will from now on regularly provide a short update on the current topics and invite you to contact us directly at any time with questions or comments. We look forward to the exchange and feedback!
